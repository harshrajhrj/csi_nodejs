# Assignment 1 : Introduction to JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?
`JavaScript` was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.
In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.

In an application, the data flow and storage control is important. More described, the application only need those data which are required and the rest are dumped. To store this information, we give a new term to this storage and that is "variables".
